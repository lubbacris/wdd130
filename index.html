            Hello, my name is Lewis Karume and I was born in Zimbabwe but I'm currently living in South Africa. I am a
            father of two beautiful daughters. I am a very hardworking and dedicated person. I am always looking for
            ways to improve myself and my skills. I have always been intrigued by web development and I am looking
            forward to the possibilities of what I can achieve whilst learning this course.
